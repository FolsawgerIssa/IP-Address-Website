      <h2>What are IP addresses?</h2>
      <p>The Internet Protocol address is used for sending data from one device to another across the internet. Every IP address uniquely identifies it and enables it to communicate with and exchange data with other devices connected to the internet. Ip address usually changes each time you establish a new network.</p>

      <h2>When can they used and how?</h2>
      <p>An example of when they can be used is even when you send a messaage, every message that is sent will establish a network. This means that whenever you send a message, your IP address can be found just from that message as it establishes a trackable network. Your IP address is essential for sending and receiving information online. However, if a hacker knows your IP address, they can use it to seize very valuable information, including your location and online identity. That is why avoiding responding to random unkown messages is important for your safety and privacy. However, IP addresses can also be used as a good thing, they can be used to open websites, for coding, for networking, and many more other things.</p>
